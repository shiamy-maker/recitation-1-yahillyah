# CSCI 1090 Fall 25 Recitation 1

You may work in groups of up to 3 on recitation assignments. Once you have completed a recitation with someone, you may not work with them on future recitations. The goal is to get you all to continue meeting classmates throughout the semester.

If working in groups, please write a short description (1 sentence per person) of how your group worked together and the contributions of each person.

### CONTRIBUTIONS BY TEAM MEMBER

Submit via Github Classroom by 11:59p ET.

## Instructions
In this lab, you’ll create a simple text-based adventure game. Walking through a maze of at least 5 rooms, the player will interact with the console to find the treasure!

1. Draw and label a map of 5 rooms. (This will be part of your  submission)
2. Start the player in room 1, put the treasure in the last room (room 5).
3. Initiate a variable currRoom which tracks which room the player is currently in.
4. Using a while loop, have the player explore the map until they find the treasure in room 5.  
5. There should be a conditional statement which provides options on cardinal directions the player can travel based on the current room and map.
6. Take input from the player about which direction they want to travel (no need to handle errors for today.)
7. Congratulate the player on finding the treasure when they enter room 5!

Your submission should include the following:
* Drawing of your map
* Code to play the game
* Brief description of team contributions in the README

See ```example-diagram.png``` for an example diagram of map; room 1 leads to room 2. Room 2 leads to 1, 3, or 4. Room 3 leads to room 2. Room 4 leads to rooms 2 and 5.
